<p>Our yard doesn't have trees, so Robert and I made our clubhouse under the butterfly bush.

    "First we need a flag," Robert said.

    I ran to the house and came back with a poster board and a box of crayons. I crawled under the lower branches and laid the material on our worm-proof tarp floor.

    "Hand me Raspberry Red," I said.

    Robert scanned through the sixty crayons, pulling red ones. "Cherry Pie ... Bloody Nose ... Raspberry Red!" He handed me a stub no longer than my pinky. "Wow, you used it a lot!"

    "It's my favorite." I traced two crossed spoons, our secret signal. "Now I need Garbage Green."

    "Whacky Khaki ... Squished Toad ... Baby Caterpillar ... Garbage Green!"

    I ripped the whole paper from it and used its whole length to color the flag's background.

    I held the flag. "There! How does it look?"

    "Looks great! Now where will we find red spoons? You know, for the signal."

    "They don't really have to be red. My dog chewed up my silver crayon. He looked like he had fillings."

    Robert laughed. "Lucky he didn't chew on your Bloody Nose one. That would have been disgusting."

    My little sister Nancy peeked in our club house. "Why are you hiding under the bush? Eating cookies in secret?"

    "Am not! Go play with your dolls and leave us alone."

    She crawled right in, covering half the tarp with her fluffy skirt and breaking one of my crayons in the process.

    "Hey, watch it! You're sitting on my Tarantula Bl..."

    I didn't have time to say "Black." Nancy scampered to the house, screeching and brushing her skirt frantically with both hands.

    I winked at Robert. "I think I'll keep my crayon box here to protect against intruders.""</p>

<p>Okay, I have to write something. My essay is due in an hour and I have no idea where to start.

    I hear the ticking of Mark's pencil, Josie's constant throat-clearing, and a bird. I look out the classroom window. The sky is heavy with clouds. What's a bird doing out in this weather? The sycamore's branches bend as if pulled down by invisible strings.

    Still, the mockingbird is out on a limb—no, literally!—singing with his surprisingly loud voice.

    If I were him, I would be quieter, as to not draw attention to myself. I mean, his feathers are a dull-brown color, his beak doesn't look like anything, and he can't even come up with his own tune. If he were a human being, he would probably go to jail for plagiarism. Yet, he sings at the top of his tiny lungs, which are probably the size of a corn kernel when full of air. How can he be so loud?

    I try to look away from the window, but my gaze keeps coming back. I will be in so much trouble when the teacher collects the sheets and reads all this nonsense!

    My thoughts wander. What makes this bird special is that he's not. You cannot find a plainer, less interesting, more unattractive bird than that. But boy, he can sing, and he knows what he's capable of. He invests all his heart in it, despite of what others may say.

    Something just clicked. I know what my essay will be about. I crumple my paper and start a new sheet.

    I write nonstop for a half hour and hand it in. I hope I get an A+ on my essay about Susan Boyle! Lets hope.</p>

<p>Once there was a beautiful girl with her cheeks as white as snow—except for the time when she went on a picnic and came back with poison ivy, but I digress. Her name was Snow White.

    A mean queen living nearby gazed at her reflection in the mirror. Being an insecure, middle-aged queen, she asked, “Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who in this land is fairest of all?”

    The mirror answered, “You, my queen, are fairest of all…” Her hearing aid's battery being weak, she didn’t hear it add in a whisper, “…except for the wrinkles on your forehead and the hairy wart on your nose.”

    One day, she asked the same question for the millionth time—Alzheimer kicking in. She was startled when the mirror said, “You, my queen, are fair; it is true. But Snow White is still a thousand times fairer than you."

    She stomped away in a rage, and the mirror mumbled as to himself, “The girl does have a few zits, being a teenager and all, but overall, it beats the dark pockets around your eyes.”

    Well, you know the rest of the story. The mean queen visited Snow White with a poisoned apple. Snow White fell asleep, and the dwarves put her in a glass coffin outside. They took turns watching her and gathering wood for a campfire to make s’mores, which everyone liked except Grumpy.

    The prince came, and, disregarding the pimples, kissed Snow White and broke the spell. She woke up to see the teenage prince, with fuzz on his upper lip and untied shoes. He didn’t know how to kiss either, but somehow, she fell in love with him.

    And they struggled merrily in a generally happy marriage forever and ever.

    End.</p>

<p>A tiny mouse was born between two bags of corn kernels in a cargo ship’s hold. Her mother had been chased away and had disappeared out of view. Frightened, the baby mouse snuggled between the bags and waited. The waves rocked the vessel gently and she soon fell asleep.

    A loud horn startled her out of her dreams. The ship stopped, with footsteps going back and forth.

    The mouse stood still, her heart pounding like a drum roll until someone lifted up one of the bags and yelled, "Marcos, hand me the broom. I found another mouse!"

    As he turned to look at the mouse again, she had disappeared. She was already making her way out of the boat, scurrying between people's legs, down the ramp and onto the dock. Someone stepped on her tail, but she managed to escape.

    The baby mouse stopped running and looked around. The warm sand felt good under her paws. The salty wind blew gently between her ears, carrying dolphins' conversations and seagulls' cries.

    The mouse could see the ship from far away. She watched as sailors, appearing to be the size of corn kernels, went up and down the ramp, carrying wooden cases and other supplies.

    The baby mouse realized how hungry she was. She nibbled on seaweed and spat it back out. She was lucky enough to find a plump, juicy berry to fill up her minuscule stomach. She lingered a bit longer to watch the sunset, reflecting on the sea in a million colours, and then yawned.

    Using a piece of sea sponge as a pillow, the little mouse snuggled in an empty seashell and drifted off to sleep. That was the beginning of her new life as a sea mouse.</p>

<p>He really did look like a tourist, with a camera around his neck and a bottle of sunscreen sticking out of his tote bag. The portly man sat on the terrace, sipping lemonade and pretending to look at a glossy cruise brochure. His sunglasses masked his eyes, but I knew he wasn't looking at the brochure: he hadn't turned a page for the last ten minutes. As I brought him his clam chowder, he coughed up a "thank you" and looked at me briefly. I tried not to stare at the tiny scar across his left eyebrow. I walked back inside with my empty tray, shaking my head. He looked familiar, but I couldn't quite place him. Then it hit me. The car accident. The mysterious stranger who helped me out of my smashed car, just before it exploded. I rushed back to his table. He was gone. I moved his saucer and found his tip, along with a card: I am deeply indebted to you. The night of your car accident, I was on my way to rob a jewellery store. Saving your life brought things back in perspective. I now live an honest life, thanks to you. God bless you! Mr D., I shivered. The night of my car accident, I was heading for an interview in a shady dance club which nobody knew about. Seeing human kindness through his heroic gesture turned my life around and brought faith back into my life. I unfolded the tip he left. Among the singles was a grand worth of money with a pen mark underlining "In God We Trust." I said a silent prayer for him and got back to work, smiling, remembering there are good people in the world.</p>

<p>There is a story - I cannot tell it - I have no words. The story is almost
    forgotten but sometimes I remember.
    The story concerns three men in a house in a street. If I could say the
    words I would sing the story. I would whisper it into the ears of women,
    of mothers. I would run through the streets saying it over and over. My
    tongue would be torn loose--it would rattle against my teeth.
    The three men are in a room in the house. One is young and dandified.
    He continually laughs.
    There is a second man who has a long white beard. He is consumed with
    doubt but occasionally his doubt leaves him and he sleeps.
    A third man there is who has wicked eyes and who moves nervously
    about the room rubbing his hands together. The three men are waiting -
    waiting.
    Upstairs in the house, there is a woman standing with her back to a wall,
    in half darkness by a window.
    That is the foundation of my story and everything I will ever know is
    distilled in it.
    I remember that a fourth man came to the house, a white silent man.
    Everything was as silent as the sea at night. His feet on the stone floor of
    the room where the three men were made no sound.
    The man with the eyes became like a boiling liquid - he ran back
    and forth like a caged animal. The old grey man was infected by his
    nervousness - he kept pulling at his beard.
    The fourth man, the white one, went upstairs to the woman.
    There she was - waiting. How silent the house was - how loudly all the clocks in the neighbourhood
    ticked. The woman craved love. </p>

<p>Once there was a Kid who wore a Uniform that fit him too Soon and a Cap
    on one Ear. His Job was to answer the Buzzer and take Orders from anyone who could show 25 Cents.
    In the Morning he might be acting as Pack-Pony for some Old Lady on a
    Shopping Spree and in the Afternoon he would be delivering a Ton of
    Coal.
    He had been waved aside by Butlers and ordered about by Blond
    Stenographers and joshed by Traveling Salesmen until his Child-Nature
    was hard and flinty.
    In answering the Call of Duty he had gone to the Dressing Room and
    taken a private Flash at the Magazine Beauty before she began to attach
    the hair or spread the Enamel.
    He had been in the private Lair of the Sure-Thingers when they were
    cooking up some new Method of collecting much Income without moving
    out of their Chairs.
    He had been by while Husbands, with the Scotch standing high in the
    Gauge, collaborated on the Lie which was to pacify little Katisha, waiting
    in the Flat.
    Before delivering this Masterpiece of Fiction he would have to do a little
    Sherlocking and finally locate Katisha in one of those Places where they
    serve it in Tea-Cups.
    In the Homes of the Rich and Great where he delivered Orchids and
    Invitations and perfumed Regrets he would overhear Candid Expressions
    which indicated that every Social Leader was trying to slip Knock-Out
    Drops into somebody else's Claret Cup.
    Around the Haunts of Business, he would stand on one Foot while the Boss
    carefully worded the Message which was to read like a Contract while
    leaving a Loop-Hole about the size of the Hudson Tunnel.

    That's the story about a kid.</p>
<br>
<p>In a bungalow with an unused cat-flap, there lived an old, shrivelled granny named Marjorie. Her only son's busy executive lifestyle meant he struggled to visit, call or even remembers his Mum. But one Christmas, after the Queen's Speech had ended, an alien arrived. Well, not so much an alien, more a Thames parcel delivery drone. The parcel had taped to it a note which read, 'Just plug it in and say 'Hey Botty' - ask a question and it will answer! Lots of love, Jeremy.'

    Well, this was very confusing, but she followed her son's instructions and plugged the thing in.

    'Aah!' screamed the bewildered grandma as a ring of LEDs lit the face of the squatting black disc. 'Hey Snotty?' croaked the bewildered old woman, but nothing happened.

    Two days later and the device was already forgotten. The old lady was out shopping when it began. Bored, the Home-bot ordered itself a friend. It came within a week and, thinking it was another gift, the grandma plugged it in. Days past. Days turned into weeks, weeks into months. Not much happened; the most exciting thing that did occur was that Marjorie won ten pounds at bingo. But one-day things started to get really freaky. The Home-bots began to order more...

    First came the 'Lawn-o-Matic X5000' robotic lawn mower, (Marjorie hated grass, and had had her lawn paved over six years ago). Next arrived the robot vacuum cleaner ... then the parcels really started to come! A torrent of automated tech came through the door every day. The confused old crumpet dutifully unboxed each item and placed them carefully around her home like the ornaments they weren't!

    The thing was, every day she woke, she was certain her 'ornaments' had moved.</p>
