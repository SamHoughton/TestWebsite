<p>From my hotel room window, I see an oversized billboard with his face on it: Jason, the Great Magician.

    I absent-mindedly turn the pages of the phone book and come across a city map. Sipping my iced latté, I run my fingers along the streets from the hotel to the opera hall. Not more than a half-hour walk.

    I glance at the clock. The show starts in one hour. Plenty of time! I gulp the last three sips of my latté and hop in the shower. Soon I’m on my way to the show, carrying a fancy black handbag and a genuine smile.

    The billboard looks even more impressive from outside. The Great Jason's eyes seem to be glancing through me. I shiver and walk faster. I feel like a child about to open her birthday presents.

    The hall is dark when I come in; the show is about to begin. I make my way backstage just as the great magician puts on his top hat.

    "Daddy, I'm so glad to see you," I say in a half-whisper. "I'm in town for the writer's workshop, but I just couldn't miss your show." I give him a quick hug and go back into the seating area, leaving him with a startled smile. I settle down in the darkness, and the curtains open.

    Magically, that show remains the Great Jason's best performance to this day.</p>

<p>He really did look like a tourist, with a camera around his neck and a bottle of sunscreen sticking out of his tote bag.

    The portly man sat on the terrace, sipping lemonade and pretending to look at a glossy cruise brochure. His sunglasses masked his eyes, but I knew he wasn't looking at the brochure: he hadn't turned a page for the last ten minutes.

    As I brought him his clam chowder, he coughed up a "thank you" and looked at me briefly. I tried not to stare at the tiny scar across his left eyebrow.

    I walked back inside with my empty tray, shaking my head. He looked familiar, but I couldn't quite place him.

    Then it hit me. The car accident. The mysterious stranger who helped me out of my smashed car, just before it exploded. I rushed back to his table.

    He was gone.

    I moved his saucer and found his tip, along with a card:

    I am deeply indebted to you. The night of your car accident, I was on my way to rob a jewelry store. Saving your life brought things back in perspective. I now live an honest life, thanks to you. God bless you! Mr. D.

    I shivered. The night of my car accident, I was heading for an interview in a shady dance club. Seeing human kindness through his heroic gesture turned my life around and brought faith back into my life.

    I unfolded the tip he left. Among the singles was a grand with a pen mark underlining "In God We Trust."

    I said a silent prayer for him and got back to work, smiling.</p>
