<p>Our yard doesn't have trees, so Robert and I made our clubhouse under the butterfly bush.

    "First we need a flag," Robert said.

    I ran to the house and came back with a poster board and a box of crayons. I crawled under the lower branches and laid the material on our worm-proof tarp floor.

    "Hand me Raspberry Red," I said.

    Robert scanned through the sixty crayons, pulling red ones. "Cherry Pie ... Bloody Nose ... Raspberry Red!" He handed me a stub no longer than my pinky. "Wow, you used it a lot!"

    "It's my favorite." I traced two crossed spoons, our secret signal. "Now I need Garbage Green."

    "Whacky Khaki ... Squished Toad ... Baby Caterpillar ... Garbage Green!"

    I ripped the whole paper from it and used its whole length to color the flag's background.

    I held the flag. "There! How does it look?"

    "Looks great! Now where will we find red spoons? You know, for the signal."

    "They don't really have to be red. My dog chewed up my silver crayon. He looked like he had fillings."

    Robert laughed. "Lucky he didn't chew on your Bloody Nose one. That would have been disgusting."

    My little sister Nancy peeked in our club house. "Why are you hiding under the bush? Eating cookies in secret?"

    "Am not! Go play with your dolls and leave us alone."

    She crawled right in, covering half the tarp with her fluffy skirt and breaking one of my crayons in the process.

    "Hey, watch it! You're sitting on my Tarantula Bl..."

    I didn't have time to say "Black." Nancy scampered to the house, screeching and brushing her skirt frantically with both hands.

    I winked at Robert. "I think I'll keep my crayon box here to protect against intruders.""</p>

<p>He really did look like a tourist, with a camera around his neck and a bottle of sunscreen sticking out of his tote bag.

    The portly man sat on the terrace, sipping lemonade and pretending to look at a glossy cruise brochure. His sunglasses masked his eyes, but I knew he wasn't looking at the brochure: he hadn't turned a page for the last ten minutes.

    As I brought him his clam chowder, he coughed up a "thank you" and looked at me briefly. I tried not to stare at the tiny scar across his left eyebrow.

    I walked back inside with my empty tray, shaking my head. He looked familiar, but I couldn't quite place him.

    Then it hit me. The car accident. The mysterious stranger who helped me out of my smashed car, just before it exploded. I rushed back to his table.

    He was gone.

    I moved his saucer and found his tip, along with a card:

    I am deeply indebted to you. The night of your car accident, I was on my way to rob a jewelry store. Saving your life brought things back in perspective. I now live an honest life, thanks to you. God bless you! Mr. D.

    I shivered. The night of my car accident, I was heading for an interview in a shady dance club. Seeing human kindness through his heroic gesture turned my life around and brought faith back into my life.

    I unfolded the tip he left. Among the singles was a grand with a pen mark underlining "In God We Trust."

    I said a silent prayer for him and got back to work, smiling.</p>

<p>Once there was a beautiful girl with her cheeks as white as snow—except for the time when she went on a picnic and came back with poison ivy, but I digress. Her name was Snow White.

    A mean queen living nearby gazed at her reflection in the mirror. Being an insecure, middle-aged queen, she asked, “Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who in this land is fairest of all?”

    The mirror answered, “You, my queen, are fairest of all…” Her hearing aid's battery being weak, she didn’t hear it add in a whisper, “…except for the wrinkles on your forehead and the hairy wart on your nose.”

    One day, she asked the same question for the millionth time—Alzheimer kicking in. She was startled when the mirror said, “You, my queen, are fair; it is true. But Snow White is still a thousand times fairer than you."

    She stomped away in a rage, and the mirror mumbled as to himself, “The girl does have a few zits, being a teenager and all, but overall, it beats the dark pockets around your eyes.”

    Well, you know the rest of the story. The mean queen visited Snow White with a poisoned apple. Snow White fell asleep, and the dwarves put her in a glass coffin outside. They took turns watching her and gathering wood for a campfire to make s’mores, which everyone liked except Grumpy.

    The prince came, and, disregarding the pimples, kissed Snow White and broke the spell. She woke up to see the teenage prince, with fuzz on his upper lip and untied shoes. He didn’t know how to kiss either, but somehow, she fell in love with him.

    And they struggled merrily in a generally happy marriage for ever and ever.

    The end.</p>

<p>A tiny mouse was born between two bags of corn kernels in a cargo ship’s hold. Her mother had been chased away and had disappeared out of view. Frightened, the baby mouse snuggled between the bags and waited. The waves rocked the vessel gently and she soon fell asleep.

    A loud horn startled her out of her dreams. The ship stopped, and many voices were heard, along with footsteps going back and forth.

    The mouse stood still, her heart pounding like a drum roll, until someone lifted up one of the bags and yelled, "Marcos, hand me the broom. I found another mouse!"

    As he turned to look at the mouse again, she had disappeared. She was already making her way out of the boat, scurrying between people's legs, down the ramp and onto the dock. Someone stepped on her tail, but she managed to escape.

    The baby mouse stopped running and looked around. The warm sand felt good under her paws. The salty wind blew gently between her ears, carrying dolphins' conversations and seagulls' cries.

    The mouse could see the ship from far away. She watched as sailors, appearing to be the size of corn kernels, went up and down the ramp, carrying wooden cases and other supplies.

    The baby mouse realized how hungry she was. She nibbled on a seaweed and spat it back out. She was lucky enough to find a plump, juicy berry to fill up her minuscule stomach. She lingered a bit longer to watch the sunset, reflecting on the sea in a million colors, and then yawned.

    Using a piece of sea sponge as a pillow, the little mouse snuggled in an empty seashell and drifted off to sleep. That was the beginning of her new life as a sea mouse.</p>

<p>Martha handed Jason a purple balloon. "Get well soon!"

    She was his third visitor. That's because she was the teacher's daughter, and her mother made her. The other two, John and Eric, weren't really his friends, although they often ganged up with him against other kids to get their lunch money.

    Jason knew he wouldn't have long to live. He could feel it, deep inside. Seeing his grandmother cry after talking with the doctor confirmed it. His time had come. He didn't tell his visitors, though. They would either pity him or be happy to get rid of him.

    Once Martha left, he ripped a page off his notebook and wrote:

    "Dear God, I know I messed up and nobody likes me. Please give me a second chance. I can show you what a good friend I can be."

    He drew a map showing the way from the church to the hospital, walked shakily to the window, and let the balloon fly away, carrying his message toward God.

    The balloon headed straight to a telephone pole, but a gentle breeze blew it away just in time. It crossed path with a duck family and disappeared out of view.

    The next day, a girl he had never met before came to visit him. "I find balloon," she said. "You are lonely?"

    He just nodded, too startled to talk.

    "I lonely too. My family come from Afghanistan and I no speak English good." She smiled. "I bring gift to you." She handed him a box of chocolates. "I pray for friend, and God give me friend."

    Normally, he would have made fun of her broken English and her long brown robe, but he knew better. He smiled and offered her the first chocolate.</p>
